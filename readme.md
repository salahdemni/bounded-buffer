#Producer–Consumer ProblemA bounded-buffer, an array of finite size, is pushed to by a prodcucer and pulled from by a consumer. Producers cannot push to a full buffer and consumers cannot pull from an empty buffer. Producers push integers into the buffer that incement sequentially. Consumers will pull integers from the buffer in first-in-first-out, FIFO, manner.##Build   Issuing the following command:  `gcc –pthread –o buffer <file-name>.c`##Run  Issue the following command to run:  `./buffer <sleep-time> < number-of-producer-threads> <number-of-consumer-threads> <first-integer-to-produce>`  For example execute the following command:`./buffer 10 2 2 10`##Aditional Notes:  When building and running, `buffer` refers to the assembly that is built when the C file is compiled.  Unnamed semiphores are not supported in Mac OSX.
